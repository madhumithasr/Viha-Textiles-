1. App Summary (for Bolt / Lovable prompt)

Build a React web app called “Viha Sarees Management”.
It is a ledger-style management system for a saree manufacturing business.
The app has three main modules:

Client Register,

Product & Stock Register,

Production Register with waste calculation, QR code and photo capture.
All main pages should look like a handwritten notebook ledger with rows and columns that are easy to scan and update.

You can copy that as the high-level description.

7. Key UX Requirements (so builders generate what you want)

When you describe to Bolt / Lovable, include lines like:

“Main pages should be ledger-style tables similar to a physical notebook, with lots of columns in a single view.”

“Use inline editing in table cells instead of big separate forms wherever possible.”

“Show side drawers / modals for detail view instead of full page navigation.”

“Use search and simple dropdown filters on top of each ledger page.”

“Support pagination at bottom of long ledgers.”
